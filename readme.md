Data from our test of EEG equipment with triggers generated by PsychoPy  

The trigger codes seem to be in channel 2 of the dataset, but there are many more of code 768 than code 770. I assume that 770 means "eyes open" but
I don't know why there would be so many more samples from the other condition.  

Triggers are in channel 2 of the data set.
